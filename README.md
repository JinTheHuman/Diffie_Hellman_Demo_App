# Diffie_Hellman_Demo_App

User Guide
To use my app, open the link https://diffie-hellman-demo.netlify.app/ on three separate windows. These can be across any three internet connected devices.

You will see the first two connections are given the names “Alice” and “Bob” while the third is given “Charlie”.

Click “create my secret key” on the “Alice” and “Bob” windows to create your private key. This will also generate your corresponding shared key.

Click “Send g^a mod n” and “Send g^b mod n” to send your shared key to the other users. Once you have received the other shared key, you will see that you now have the Secret key which is calculated as g^ab mod n.
Send messages via the chat and enter the Secret Key to decrypt them.
